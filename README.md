# Penetration Test

[Youtube Demo Video](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FP-RHP-mDKI)

This is a little game demo I made for CatHacks VII. It's inspired by a certain notable glitch in Super Mario 64 where players can get themselves stuck on level geometry while still accumulating speed - eventually they will accumulate enough speed to pass through solid objects entirely.

So I've created this game with a few levels involving using a similar mechanic. The player can "glitch" through walls and in doing so can accumulate enough speed to bypass obstacles. Right now there's only five levels, but I think they get across the idea I had in mind coming up with this mechanic.

On the technical side, I decided to forego using a traditional game engine like Unity or Unreal for this project. It's written entirely in C, using SDL for graphics and such.
